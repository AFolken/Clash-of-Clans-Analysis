# Clash-of-Clans-Analysis
Analysis of Clash of Clans
This analysis produces a 3d plot of the stats of troops, buildings, and heros in Clash of Clans.

Dark Elixir was increased by two orders of magnitude (I multiplied it by 100) to account for its rarity and thus make it more comparable to Elixir troops. 
Based on current gem prices of the elixirs:
5000000Elixir/1667gems = 2999.4 Elixer/gem
100000DElixer/3000 = 33.3 DElixer/gem
So roughly 100 times.

In one of the plots (p2) I divide each measure by the housing space of the troop. I thought this would be interesting to see. For instance, while the Pekka does 610 damage (a lot more than any other troop) it takes up 25 housing space. That means for each space of housing you are doing 24.4 damage per second. A wizard will do 57.5 damage per second per housing space; over twice as much!
